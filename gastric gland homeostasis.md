# Gastric Gland Homeostasis

## [Gastric Stem Cells: Physiological and Pathological Perspectives](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.571536/full)
- Epithelial cells renewed about every 3 days
- Corpus glands in upper stomach
- Antrum glands closer to small intestines
- Gastric stem cells similar to intestinal, differ in fundamental aspects
    - Location
    - Molecular cell markers
    - Specific growth niches
- 5 Differentiated cell types
    - Surface mucus cells
    - Mucus neck cells
    - Parietal cells
    - Chief cells
    - Enterendocrine cells
    - Tuft cells
- Corpus glands top to bottom
    - Pit (Surface mucus)
    - Isthmus (Stem, Progenitor)
    - Neck (Parietal, mucous)
    - Base (Chief, Stem, ECL, Tuft)
- Antrum glands top to bottom
    - Pit (Surface mucus)
    - Isthmus (Stem, Progenitor)
    - Base (Mucous, Tuft, Stem)
- Isthmus may be pool of stem-like cells in adult stomach
    - Complex bi-directional migration toward pit and base
- Cells in base second stem cell pool capable of self renewal and differentiation
- Able to determine differentiation direction in anatomic regions under normal vs abnormal conditions
- Lgr5+ glands at base of pyloric glands are long-term and responsible for epithelial homeostasis
    - Differentiate into surface mucus, enteroendocrine and parietal cells
- Lgr5 also found in subpopulation of chief cells in antral base
    - Lgr5+ cells here damage-induced for gland regeneration
- In corpus:
    - TFF2 mRNA-expressing cells in Isthmus region responsible for mucus neck, parietal and chief cells. Not for pit or ECL lineages
    - Mist1+/Lgr5- can give rise to surface mucus, mucus neck, parietal, tuft and ECL cells.
- Major gastric gland regulation pathways
    - Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
        - Parietal cells and glandular portion
    - Bone Morphogenic proteins (BMPs)
        - Regulatory peptides from interstitial myofibrast-like cells
        - Targets neck and isthmus
    - Notch in Antrum
        - Stimulates Lgr5+ proliferation but reduces differentiation
    - Wnt
        - Maintain undifferentiated state of progenitors in Isthmus
        - Activation increases progenitor cells in antrum
    - FGF-10
    - EGF


## [Apoptosis in the Gastric Mucosa: Molecular Mechanisms, Basic and Clinical Implications](https://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/03_00/pdf/3_03_00_article.pdf)
- Apoptosis $\textrm{TNF}\alpha$ and CD95L/FasL
- $\textrm{TNF}\alpha$ from Genotoxic stress
- Fas expressed at low level in most tissues including gastric mucosa


## [Morphogen Signals Shaping the Gastric Glands in Health and Disease](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/7/3632)
- Morphogen signals:
    - WNT / $\beta$-catenin
    - Hedgehog (Hh)
    - Bone Morphogenetic PRotein (BMP)
    - Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)
    - Notch
    - Retinoic Acid (RA)
- Cells in Isthmus responsible for normal epithelial turnover
    - Progenitor cells (transit amplifying)
    - Controlled by food, hormones, growth factors
    - Migrate towards pit and base
- Another set of cells in base are activated in case of epithelial damage
    - Long lived
    - Multipotent
    - Capable of self-renewal
    - Enter quiescent state of non-division
- Marker genes to find regenerative stem cells:
    - Wnt pathway
        - Lgr5
        - Axin2
        - Aqp5
        - Troy
    - Other organs
        - Mist1
        - Lrig1
    - Endoderm development
        - Sox2
        - Bmi1
- Differentiated cells can regenerate
    - Troy Mist1 Lrig1 expressed in differentiated chief cells
    - Lrig1 in differentiated parietal cells
- Wnt is main morphogen pathway
    - Signalling enhanced by R-spondins (stabilising LGR4,5,6 receptors)
    - Mice Antrum:
        - 2 sets of stem cells
            - Axin2+ Lgr5+ gland base
            - Axin2+ Lgr5- above base
        - Axin2+ Lgr5- hyperproliferation with R-spondin3. Axin2+ Lgr5+ no response
        - Wnt11 found throughout mucosa in mice antrum
        - R-spondin3 found in stromal myofibroblasts near base of gland
    - Soluble inhibitors in stomach
        - FRP1, DKK1, DKK3 found in stroma of lamina propria between glands
- Egfr role in gland homeostasis, particularly in foveolar compartment
    - Observed mostly in lumen of human stomach
    - Differentiation towards foveolar phenotype in corpus epithelium (pit epithelium)
    - EGF and TGF-$\alpha$ expressed at foveolar and isthmus regions
    - mTor (a tyrosine protein kinase) can be activated by EGFRor other RTKs (and other pathways)
        - Controls LGR5+ homeostasis
            - Promotes proliferation
            - Maintains undifferentiated state
            - In injury reprogramme differentiated cell to function as stem cell
            - Chief cells in corpus can re-enter cell cycle as stem cells
- TGF-$\beta$ (BMPs)
    - BMP4 promotes foveolar differentiation in combination with EGFR
    - Promotes parietal differentiation if EGFR is inactive
    - BMPs expressed more in isthmus
    - NOGGIN inhibits this from muscularis mucosae below glands
    - Possible BMP4 inhibits Wnt signalling
- NOTCH
    - Direct interactions of cells expressing ligand / receptor
    - In mice
        - Inhibition of Notch -> reduction in Lgr5+, reduction in proliferation and increased differentiation
        - Notch may modulate progenitar proliferation and differentiation
        - Specific to stomach antrum but not corpus
- Hedgehog
    - Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Desert Hedgehog (Dhh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh)
    - Controlling proliferation, differentiation, acid secretion and divison of adult stem cells
    - Regulated by gastrin $\therefore$ linked to parietal cells
    - Shh can also be triggered by calcium release via activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC)

- Stem cells in isthmus
    - Upward moving cells become pit-progenitor
    - Downward moving become neck-progenitor
    - Small chance of parietal progenitor
- Neck-progenitor cells become neck cells then differentiate to chief cells in base
- Corpus
    - Pit cells arise from progenitor in isthmus
        - Damage to isthmus larger effect on pit than base
        - Normal conditions most proliferation in isthmus is upward moving
    - Notch signalling active in isthmus
        - Promotes proliferation
    - BMP regulates progenitor proliferation and cell maturation in corpus
    - Gastrin produced by G cells in antrum
        - Promotes acid secretion by activating ECL and parietal cells
        - Absence leads to immature parietal and ECL cells
        - Overexpression increased parietal and ECL
        - Negative feedback
            - Parietal cells produce Shh
            - Absence of Shh -> increased gastrin
- Antrum less complex
    - Faster turnover
    - Proliferation in isthmus spreads upwards and downwards
    - Notch regulates Lgr5+ stem cells
    - Inhibition of Notch promotes mucous and endocrine differentiation
    - Activation of Notch stops differentiation
    - Absence of BMPR1A antral mucous cells hyperproliferate + fail to express mucin MUC5AC
    - Maybe role for Wnt signalling in antral homeostasis
        - Lgr5 co-receptor for Wnt
