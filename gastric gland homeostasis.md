# Gastric Gland Homeostasis

## [Gastric Stem Cells: Physiological and Pathological Perspectives](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2020.571536/full)
- Epithelial cells renewed about every 3 days
- Corpus glands in upper stomach
- Antrum glands closer to small intestines
- Gastric stem cells similar to intestinal, differ in fundamental aspects
    - Location
    - Molecular cell markers
    - Specific growth niches
- 5 Differentiated cell types
    - Surface mucus cells
    - Mucus neck cells
    - Parietal cells
    - Chief cells
    - Enterendocrine cells
    - Tuft cells
- Corpus glands top to bottom
    - Pit (Surface mucus)
    - Isthmus (Stem, Progenitor)
    - Neck (Parietal, mucous)
    - Base (Chief, Stem, ECL, Tuft)
- Antrum glands top to bottom
    - Pit (Surface mucus)
    - Isthmus (Stem, Progenitor)
    - Base (Mucous, Tuft, Stem)
- Isthmus may be pool of stem-like cells in adult stomach
    - Complex bi-directional migration toward pit and base
- Cells in base second stem cell pool capable of self renewal and differentiation
- Able to determine differentiation direction in anatomic regions under normal vs abnormal conditions
- Lgr5+ glands at base of pyloric glands are long-term and responsible for epithelial homeostasis
    - Differentiate into surface mucus, enteroendocrine and parietal cells
- Lgr5 also found in subpopulation of chief cells in antral base
    - Lgr5+ cells here damage-induced for gland regeneration
- In corpus:
    - TFF2 mRNA-expressing cells in Isthmus region responsible for mucus neck, parietal and chief cells. Not for pit or ECL lineages
    - Mist1+/Lgr5- can give rise to surface mucus, mucus neck, parietal, tuft and ECL cells.
- Major gastric gland regulation pathways
    - Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
        - Parietal cells and glandular portion
    - Bone Morphogenic proteins (BMPs)
        - Regulatory peptides from interstitial myofibrast-like cells
        - Targets neck and isthmus
    - Notch in Antrum
        - Stimulates Lgr5+ proliferation but reduces differentiation
